# Data Fetching Patterns

Reliable frontends treat the network as lossy and unpredictable. These patterns help you model server interaction, caching, and synchronization so UI stays trustworthy under stress.

## Start with Strategy

- Define ownership with [Server State vs Client State](/server-state-vs-client-state) to decide which layer tracks truth.
- Keep requests in check using [Parallel Request](/parallel-request), [Dependent Query](/dependent-query), and [Query Deduplication](/query-deduplication) to avoid redundant calls.
- Manage lifecycle edges with [Request Cancellation](/request-cancellation), [Retry](/retry), and [Stale-While-Revalidate](/stale-while-revalidate) for resilient UX under latency spikes.

## Delivery Playbook

1. Wrap critical flows in [Async Boundary](/async-boundary) and [Error Boundary](/error-boundary) components to fail gracefully.
2. Log cache hits, misses, and mutation conflicts so you can tune policies with real data.
3. Document data contracts next to componentsâ€”include example payloads, loading states, and optimistic assumptions to keep teams aligned.
