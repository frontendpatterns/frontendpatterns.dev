# Testing Patterns

Confidence comes from a thoughtful test pyramid. These patterns show how to layer fast feedback with high-fidelity coverage so regressions surface before production.

## Build the Ladder

- Cover logic with [Component Testing](/component-testing) and [Stateful Logic Testing](/stateful-logic-testing) to keep units cheap and deterministic.
- Validate integrations using [Integration Testing](/integration-testing), [Test Data Builder](/test-data-builder), and [Mock Service Worker](/mock-service-worker) for realistic network boundaries.
- Guard perception with [Visual Regression](/visual-regression) and accessibility commitments via [Accessibility Testing](/accessibility-testing).

## Keep It Healthy

1. Track flake rates and quarantine unstable suites before they erode trust.
2. Automate CI gates that run the right tiers on push, PR, and release branches.
3. Pair failures with actionable error messages and observability breadcrumbs so debugging stays quick.
