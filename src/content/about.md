# About Frontend Patterns

## Why This Exists

When building modern web applications, you face the same architectural decisions over and over:

- Should I use BEM or CSS-in-JS?
- When do I need server-side rendering?
- How do I implement accessible modals?
- What's the right state management pattern?

**MDN tells you what APIs do.**  
**Framework docs explain their specific approach.**  
**But nobody provides comprehensive, framework-agnostic architectural guidance.**

This site fills that gap.

## What This Is

Frontend Patterns is a comprehensive reference for modern frontend architecture. It covers:

- **Patterns** - Production-ready implementations of UI components, CSS organization, rendering strategies, state management, and more
- **Guides** - Decision frameworks to help you choose between approaches
- **Real code** - Complete examples you can learn from and adapt

Not just theory. Not framework-specific. **Practical patterns for real applications.**

## How It's Different

**vs. MDN:**  
MDN documents APIs. We show you how to use them in complete architectural patterns.

**vs. Component Libraries:**  
Libraries give you ready-made components in specific frameworks. We teach you the underlying patterns so you can build them yourself, anywhere.

**vs. Framework Docs:**  
Framework docs are framework-specific. Our patterns work with any framework (or no framework).

## Who This Is For

**Mid to senior frontend engineers** who need:
- Production-ready patterns, not basic tutorials
- Architectural guidance, not just code snippets
- Framework-agnostic solutions they can adapt
- Decision frameworks for choosing between approaches

If you're building applications at scale, design systems, or component libraries then this is for you.

## The Approach

Every pattern follows the same structure:

1. **The Problem** - What real-world issue does this solve?
2. **The Solution** - Complete implementation with code
3. **How It Works** - Detailed explanation
4. **When to Use** - Specific scenarios where this pattern fits
5. **When NOT to Use** - Cases where alternatives are better
6. **Trade-offs** - Honest pros and cons
7. **Variations** - Different approaches to the same problem

**No prescriptive "do it this way."** We show multiple approaches, explain trade-offs, and help you make informed decisions.

## Who's Behind This

I'm **Den Odell**, a frontend architect with 25+ years of experience building web applications at scale.

I've worked on:
- Design systems and component libraries at Volvo Cars
- Large-scale React applications
- Accessibility-first interfaces
- Performance-critical frontends

I've also:
- Published 2 technical books (50,000+ downloads)
- Written articles reaching 60,000+ developers
- Spoken at conferences on frontend architecture
- Judged the WebAwards for technical excellence

I created this site because I kept seeing the same patterns being reinvented, the same questions being asked, and the same architectural decisions being made without clear guidance.

**There should be a comprehensive reference for frontend architecture. Now there is.**

## What's Next

This site launched in [Month Year] with [X] patterns and [Y] guides. The goal is to build a comprehensive catalog covering all aspects of frontend architecture.

**Planned:**
- 80+ patterns across UI, CSS, rendering, state, data, performance, and architecture
- Interactive examples and demos
- Learning paths for progressive skill building
- Case studies from production applications

**Follow along:**
- [Newsletter](#) - Monthly updates
- [Twitter](#) - Quick tips and announcements
- [LinkedIn](#) - Long-form thoughts on frontend
