# Generic Component

Create reusable components that work with multiple data types.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that creating reusable components that work with multiple data types falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Generic Component pattern by creating reusable components that work with multiple data types, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
