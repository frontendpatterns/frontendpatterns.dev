# Screen Reader

## Problem

Screen reader users encounter unlabeled buttons, images without alt text, and dynamic content changes that go unannounced. They navigate through garbled content order, meaningless link text like "click here," and form fields without proper labels, making interfaces frustrating or impossible to use.

## Solution

Apply the Screen Reader pattern by optimizing content structure and announcements for screen reader users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
