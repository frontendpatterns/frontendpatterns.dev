# Screen Reader

Optimize content structure and announcements for screen reader users.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that optimizing content structure and announcements for screen reader users falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on accessibility concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Screen Reader pattern by optimizing content structure and announcements for screen reader users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
