# Local Development Pattern

Optimize the developer experience with fast builds, hot reload, and debugging tools.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that optimizing the developer experience with fast builds, hot reload, and debugging tools falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Local Development pattern by optimizing the developer experience with fast builds, hot reload, and debugging tools, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
