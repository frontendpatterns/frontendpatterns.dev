# Local Development

## Problem

Slow build times and missing hot reload force developers to wait seconds or minutes after every code change to see results. Without proper debugging tools, developers resort to console.log debugging and manual browser refreshes, making the development cycle frustratingly slow and unproductive.

## Solution

Optimize the developer experience with fast builds, hot reload, and debugging tools. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
