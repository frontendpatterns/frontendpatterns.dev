# Utility Type

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that leveraging built-in or custom utility types to transform and manipulate types falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Utility Type pattern by leveraging built-in or custom utility types to transform and manipulate types, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
