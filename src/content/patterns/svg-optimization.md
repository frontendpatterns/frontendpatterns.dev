# SVG Optimization

## Problem

SVG files exported from design tools contain bloated metadata, comments, and unnecessary attributes that balloon file sizes. Icon libraries accumulate hundreds of kilobytes from unoptimized vectors. Complex paths with excessive precision make files larger than needed. Pages load slowly because SVG assets haven't been compressed or cleaned.

## Solution

Remove unnecessary metadata and simplifying paths to reduce SVG file sizes. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
