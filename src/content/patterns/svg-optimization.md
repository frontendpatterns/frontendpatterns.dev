# SVG Optimization

Remove unnecessary metadata and simplify paths to reduce SVG file sizes.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that removing unnecessary metadata and simplifying paths to reduce SVG file sizes falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on performance concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the SVG Optimization pattern by removing unnecessary metadata and simplifying paths to reduce SVG file sizes, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
