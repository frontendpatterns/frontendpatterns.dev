# Image Optimization

Compressing, resizing, and serving images in modern formats to reduce bandwidth usage.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that compressing, resizing, and serving images in modern formats to reduce bandwidth falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Image Optimization pattern by compressing, resizing, and serving images in modern formats to reduce bandwidth, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
