# Image Optimization

## Problem

Unoptimized images account for megabytes of page weight, dominating load times on slow connections. Designers export full-resolution PNGs that are 10x larger than necessary. Mobile users download desktop-sized images, wasting bandwidth and battery. Pages visually load but remain sluggish while massive hero images trickle in.

## Solution

Compressing, resizing, and serving images in modern formats to reduce bandwidth. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
