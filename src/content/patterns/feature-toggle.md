# Feature Toggle

## Problem

Deploying incomplete features to production is risky, but keeping long-running feature branches creates merge conflicts and integration headaches. You want to merge code frequently, but you need to control when features become visible to users. Tying feature releases to code deployments makes rollbacks slow and prevents testing features with specific user segments.

## Solution

Apply the Feature Toggle pattern by conditionally enabling or disabling features without code deployments, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
