# Feature Toggle

Enable or disabling features conditionally without code deployments.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that conditionally enabling or disabling features without code deployments falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Feature Toggle pattern by conditionally enabling or disabling features without code deployments, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
