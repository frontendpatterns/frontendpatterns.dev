# Feature Toggle

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that conditionally enabling or disabling features without code deployments falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Feature Toggle pattern by conditionally enabling or disabling features without code deployments, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
