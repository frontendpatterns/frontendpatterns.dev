# Accessible Forms

Create forms with proper labels, error messages, and state announcements for all users.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that creating forms with proper labels, error messages, and state announcements for all users falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on accessibility concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Accessible Forms pattern by creating forms with proper labels, error messages, and state announcements for all users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
