# Accessible Forms

Create forms with proper labels, error messages, and state announcements for all users.

## Problem

Screen reader users can't determine what each form field is asking for, keyboard-only users struggle to navigate between inputs, and error messages appear visually but aren't announced to assistive technology. This excludes millions of users from completing critical tasks like sign-up, checkout, or profile updates.

## Solution

Apply the Accessible Forms pattern by creating forms with proper labels, error messages, and state announcements for all users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
