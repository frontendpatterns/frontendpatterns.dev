# Hot Module Replacement

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that updating code in running applications without full page reloads for faster iteration falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Hot Module Replacement pattern by updating code in running applications without full page reloads for faster iteration, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
