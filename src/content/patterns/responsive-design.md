# Responsive Design

Create layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that creating layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Responsive Design pattern by creating layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
