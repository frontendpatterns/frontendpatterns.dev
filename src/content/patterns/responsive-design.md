# Responsive Design

## Problem

Interfaces look broken on mobile devices with text cut off, buttons unreachable, and horizontal scrolling required. Desktop-optimized layouts force mobile users to pinch and zoom constantly, while fixed-width designs overflow on tablets. Each device size creates a different broken experience, frustrating users and hurting engagement.

## Solution

Create layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
