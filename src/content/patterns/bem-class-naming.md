# BEM Class Naming

## Problem

CSS class names lack consistent structure, making it unclear which elements belong together or how they relate. Developers create names like "btn-primary", "button-large", and "big-blue-button" for the same component, leading to confusion about which classes to use and difficulty understanding the codebase hierarchy.

## Solution

Apply the BEM Class Naming pattern by structuring CSS class names with Block, Element, Modifier methodology for clarity and reusability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
