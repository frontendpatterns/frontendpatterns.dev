# BEM Class Naming Pattern

Structure CSS class names with Block, Element, Modifier methodology for clarity and reusability.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that structuring CSS class names with Block, Element, Modifier methodology for clarity and reusability falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on styling concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the BEM Class Naming pattern by structuring CSS class names with Block, Element, Modifier methodology for clarity and reusability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
