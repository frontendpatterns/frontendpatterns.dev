# CSS Custom Properties

Use CSS variables for dynamic styling and easy theme customization.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that using CSS variables for dynamic styling and easy theme customization falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on styling concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the CSS Custom Properties pattern by using CSS variables for dynamic styling and easy theme customization, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
