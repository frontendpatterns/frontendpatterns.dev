# CSS Custom Properties

## Problem

Design values like colors, spacing, and font sizes are hardcoded throughout stylesheets with magic numbers and repeated values. Changing a brand color or adjusting spacing requires finding and updating dozens of instances across multiple files, often missing some and creating visual inconsistencies.

## Solution

Apply the CSS Custom Properties pattern by using CSS variables for dynamic styling and easy theme customization, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
