# User Interaction Testing

Simulate user events like clicks and typing to test real-world behavior.

## Problem

Tests that directly manipulate component state miss bugs that users encounter. Event handlers break, form submissions fail, or click interactions don't trigger the expected behavior because tests bypass the actual DOM event system that users interact with.

## Solution

Apply the User Interaction Testing pattern by simulating user events like clicks and typing to test real-world behavior, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
