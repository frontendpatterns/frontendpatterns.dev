# User Interaction Testing Pattern

Simulate user events like clicks and typing to test real-world behavior.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that simulating user events like clicks and typing to test real-world behavior falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the User Interaction Testing pattern by simulating user events like clicks and typing to test real-world behavior, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
