# Visual Regression

Compare screenshots to detect unintended visual changes automatically.

## Problem

CSS changes, dependency updates, or component refactors introduce subtle visual bugs that go unnoticed until users report them. Layouts shift unexpectedly, colors change, spacing breaks, or responsive breakpoints fail without anyone catching it during development.

## Solution

Apply the Visual Regression pattern by comparing screenshots to detect unintended visual changes automatically, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
