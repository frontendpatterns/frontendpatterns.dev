# Visual Regression

Compare screenshots to detect unintended visual changes automatically.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that comparing screenshots to detect unintended visual changes automatically falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Visual Regression pattern by comparing screenshots to detect unintended visual changes automatically, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
