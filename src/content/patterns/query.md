# Query Strategy

Select DOM elements using accessible queries that mirror user interaction.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that selecting DOM elements using accessible queries that mirror user interaction falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Query Strategy pattern by selecting DOM elements using accessible queries that mirror user interaction, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
