# Stateful Logic Testing

## Problem

Complex state logic embedded in components becomes difficult to test thoroughly without rendering entire component trees. Reducers, selectors, or custom hooks contain business logic that needs comprehensive testing, but testing through UI interactions is slow and brittle.

## Solution

Test state management logic independently from presentation. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
