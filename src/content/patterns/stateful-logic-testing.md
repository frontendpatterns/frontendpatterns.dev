# Stateful Logic Testing Pattern

Test state management logic independently from presentation.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that testing state management logic independently from presentation falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Stateful Logic Testing pattern by testing state management logic independently from presentation, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
