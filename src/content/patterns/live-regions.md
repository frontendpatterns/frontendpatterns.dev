# Live Regions

## Problem

Screen reader users miss critical updates when content changes dynamically. Toast notifications, form validation errors, or loading states appear visually but remain silent to assistive technology. Users don't know when async operations complete, items are added to a cart, or errors occur unless they manually navigate to check.

## Solution

Announce dynamic content updates to screen readers using ARIA live regions without disrupting user flow. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
