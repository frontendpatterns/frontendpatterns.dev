# Live Regions Pattern

Announce dynamic content updates to screen readers using ARIA live regions without disrupting user flow.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that announcing dynamic content updates to screen readers using ARIA live regions without disrupting user flow falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on accessibility concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Live Regions pattern by announcing dynamic content updates to screen readers using ARIA live regions without disrupting user flow, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
