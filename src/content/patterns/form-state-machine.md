# Form State Machine

Model form states (pristine, dirty, submitting, error) as explicit state transitions.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that modeling form states (pristine, dirty, submitting, error) as explicit state transitions falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Form State Machine pattern by modeling form states (pristine, dirty, submitting, error) as explicit state transitions, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
