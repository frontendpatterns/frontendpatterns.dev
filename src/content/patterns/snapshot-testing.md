# Snapshot Testing

Capture component output and detecting unintended changes over time.

## Problem

Component refactoring accidentally changes output structure, breaking downstream consumers or causing subtle rendering differences. Developers don't realize a "harmless" change altered the DOM structure, class names, or data attributes that other code depends on.

## Solution

Apply the Snapshot Testing pattern by capturing component output and detecting unintended changes over time, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
