# Snapshot Testing

Capture component output and detecting unintended changes over time.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that capturing component output and detecting unintended changes over time falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Snapshot Testing pattern by capturing component output and detecting unintended changes over time, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
