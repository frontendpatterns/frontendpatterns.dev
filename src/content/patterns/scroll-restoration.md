# Scroll Restoration

## Problem

Users who navigate back from a detail page return to the top of long lists, losing their place entirely. They must scroll through hundreds of items to find where they left off, making browsing catalog or feed-based interfaces frustrating and inefficient.

## Solution

Remember and restore scroll positions when navigating backward. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
