# Route Guard

## Problem

Protected content briefly flashes on screen before auth checks redirect users, creating security concerns and poor user experience. Each route must manually check permissions, leading to scattered authentication logic and easy-to-miss security holes.

## Solution

Protect routes with authentication, authorization, or validation checks before rendering. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
