# Route Guard

Protect routes with authentication, authorization, or validation checks before rendering.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that protecting routes with authentication, authorization, or validation checks before rendering falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Route Guard pattern by protecting routes with authentication, authorization, or validation checks before rendering, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
