# Error State Testing

Test explicitly how components handle errors and edge cases.

## Problem

Components only get tested with happy-path data, so error states, loading failures, and edge cases crash in production. Network errors show blank screens, validation failures break forms, and null data causes uncaught exceptions because these scenarios were never tested.

## Solution

Apply the Error State Testing pattern by explicitly testing how components handle errors and edge cases, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
