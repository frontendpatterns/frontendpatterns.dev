# Error State Testing

Test explicitly how components handle errors and edge cases.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that explicitly testing how components handle errors and edge cases falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Error State Testing pattern by explicitly testing how components handle errors and edge cases, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
