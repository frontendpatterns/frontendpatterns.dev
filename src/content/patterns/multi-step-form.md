# Multi-Step Form Pattern

Break long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that breaking long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Multi-Step Form pattern by breaking long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
