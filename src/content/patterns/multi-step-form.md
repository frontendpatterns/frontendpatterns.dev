# Multi-Step Form

## Problem

Long forms overwhelm users with dozens of fields at once, leading to abandonment. Managing validation across all fields simultaneously becomes complex. Users can't save progress and return later, and it's unclear how much of the form remains incomplete or which sections have errors.

## Solution

Apply the Multi-Step Form pattern by breaking long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
