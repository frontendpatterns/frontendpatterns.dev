# Multi-Step Form

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that breaking long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Multi-Step Form pattern by breaking long forms into sequential steps with progress tracking and navigation, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
