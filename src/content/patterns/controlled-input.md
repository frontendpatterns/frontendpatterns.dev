# Controlled Input Pattern

Synchronize form inputs with component state for full programmatic control.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that synchronizing form inputs with component state for full programmatic control falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Controlled Input pattern by synchronizing form inputs with component state for full programmatic control, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
