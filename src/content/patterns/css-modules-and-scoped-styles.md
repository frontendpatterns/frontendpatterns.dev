# CSS Modules & Scoped Styles

## Problem

CSS class names collide across components, causing button styles to leak into cards or typography changes to affect unrelated pages. Developers resort to increasingly specific selectors or !important to override conflicts, making stylesheets unmaintainable and fragile.

## Solution

Apply the CSS Modules & Scoped Styles pattern by automatically scoping CSS to specific components to prevent global style conflicts, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
