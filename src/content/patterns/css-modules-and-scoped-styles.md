# CSS Modules & Scoped Styles

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that automatically scoping CSS to specific components to prevent global style conflicts falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the CSS Modules & Scoped Styles pattern by automatically scoping CSS to specific components to prevent global style conflicts, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
