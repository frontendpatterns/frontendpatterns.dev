# History Management

## Problem

Browser back and forward buttons behave unexpectedly in complex workflows like multi-step forms or modal dialogs. Each UI state change pollutes history, trapping users in endless back-button cycles, or legitimate navigation steps get skipped entirely.

## Solution

Apply the History Management pattern by programmatically controlling browser history for custom back/forward behavior, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
