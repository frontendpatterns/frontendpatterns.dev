# History Management

Control browser history programmatically for custom back/forward behavior.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that programmatically controlling browser history for custom back/forward behavior falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on routing and navigation concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the History Management pattern by programmatically controlling browser history for custom back/forward behavior, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
