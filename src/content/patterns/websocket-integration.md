# WebSocket Integration

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that establishing persistent connections for real-time bidirectional communication falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the WebSocket Integration pattern by establishing persistent connections for real-time bidirectional communication, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
