# E2E Testing

Test complete user flows through the application in a browser environment.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that testing complete user flows through the application in a browser environment falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the E2E Testing pattern by testing complete user flows through the application in a browser environment, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
