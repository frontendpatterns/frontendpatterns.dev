# E2E Testing

Test complete user flows through the application in a browser environment.

## Problem

Critical user journeys like checkout, signup, or data submission break in production despite passing unit tests. Network timing issues, browser-specific quirks, or third-party service failures cause workflows to fail in ways that isolated tests can't detect.

## Solution

Apply the E2E Testing pattern by testing complete user flows through the application in a browser environment, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
