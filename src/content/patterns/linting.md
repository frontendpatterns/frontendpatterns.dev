# Linting Pattern

Enforce code quality and consistency rules automatically during development.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that enforcing code quality and consistency rules automatically during development falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Linting pattern by enforcing code quality and consistency rules automatically during development, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
