# Linting

## Problem

Code quality issues slip through to production: unused variables, missing error handling, accessibility violations, and subtle bugs that could be caught automatically. Developers discover these issues too late in code review or worse, in production, requiring costly fixes and rework.

## Solution

Apply the Linting pattern by enforcing code quality and consistency rules automatically during development, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
