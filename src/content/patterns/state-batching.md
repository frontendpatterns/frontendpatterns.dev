# State Batching Pattern

Group multiple state updates together to minimize re-renders and improve performance.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that grouping multiple state updates together to minimize re-renders and improve performance falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the State Batching pattern by grouping multiple state updates together to minimize re-renders and improve performance, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
