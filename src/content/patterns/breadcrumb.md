# Breadcrumb

## Problem

Users deep in nested views have no sense of where they are in the application hierarchy or how to navigate back up levels. They rely solely on browser back buttons, which may skip intermediate levels or take them completely out of the current section.

## Solution

Display hierarchical navigation trail showing user's location in the application. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
