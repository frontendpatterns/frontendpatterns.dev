# Breadcrumb

Display hierarchical navigation trail showing user's location in the application.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that displaying hierarchical navigation trail showing user's location in the application falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Breadcrumb pattern by displaying hierarchical navigation trail showing user's location in the application, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
