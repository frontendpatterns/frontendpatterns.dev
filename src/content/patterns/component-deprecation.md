# Component Deprecation Strategy

Retire outdated components gracefully with warnings, codemods, and migration guides to move consumers to newer alternatives.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that gracefully retiring outdated components with warnings, codemods, and migration guides to move consumers to newer alternatives falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Component Deprecation Strategy pattern by gracefully retiring outdated components with warnings, codemods, and migration guides to move consumers to newer alternatives, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
