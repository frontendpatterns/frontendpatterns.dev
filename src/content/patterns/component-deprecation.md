# Component Deprecation Strategy

## Problem

Outdated components linger in the codebase with no clear migration path. Developers unknowingly use deprecated components because there are no warnings, causing technical debt to accumulate. When old components are finally removed, it breaks dozens of places across the application with no guidance on how to migrate.

## Solution

Apply the Component Deprecation Strategy pattern by gracefully retiring outdated components with warnings, codemods, and migration guides to move consumers to newer alternatives, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
