# Integration Testing

## Problem

Individual components work in isolation but fail when combined. Data doesn't flow correctly between parent and child components, context providers break, or routing transitions cause unexpected state loss. These integration bugs only surface when users follow real workflows.

## Solution

Apply the Integration Testing pattern by testing multiple components working together as a cohesive unit, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
