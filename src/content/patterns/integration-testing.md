# Integration Testing

Test multiple components working together as a cohesive unit.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that testing multiple components working together as a cohesive unit falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Integration Testing pattern by testing multiple components working together as a cohesive unit, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
