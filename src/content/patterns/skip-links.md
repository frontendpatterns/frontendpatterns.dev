# Skip Links

Allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and jump to main content.

## Problem

Keyboard and screen reader users must tab through dozens of navigation links on every page load before reaching the main content. This wastes time and creates frustration, especially on content-heavy sites where users just want to read an article or complete a task.

## Solution

Apply the Skip Links pattern by allowing keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and jump to main content, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
