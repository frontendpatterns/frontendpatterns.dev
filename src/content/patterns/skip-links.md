# Skip Links

Allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and jump to main content.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that allowing keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and jump to main content falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Skip Links pattern by allowing keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation elements and jump to main content, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
