# Semantic HTML

Use correct HTML elements to convey meaning and structure before reaching for ARIA attributes.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that using correct HTML elements to convey meaning and structure before reaching for ARIA attributes falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Semantic HTML pattern by using correct HTML elements to convey meaning and structure before reaching for ARIA attributes, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
