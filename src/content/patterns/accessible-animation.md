# Accessible Animation

## Problem

Animations trigger nausea, dizziness, or vestibular issues for users with motion sensitivity. Rapid movements, parallax scrolling, or auto-playing animations can cause physical discomfort or make interfaces completely unusable for people with vestibular disorders.

## Solution

Combine motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
