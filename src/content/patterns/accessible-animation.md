# Accessible Animation

Combine motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users.

## Problem

Animations trigger nausea, dizziness, or vestibular issues for users with motion sensitivity. Rapid movements, parallax scrolling, or auto-playing animations can cause physical discomfort or make interfaces completely unusable for people with vestibular disorders.

## Solution

Apply the Accessible Animation pattern by combining motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
