# Accessible Animation Pattern

Combine motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that combining motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on accessibility concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Accessible Animation pattern by combining motion preferences with safe easing curves and timing to create animations that work for all users, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
