# Font Loading Strategy

Control how and when web fonts load to prevent layout shifts and invisible text.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that controlling how and when web fonts load to prevent layout shifts and invisible text falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Font Loading Strategy pattern by controlling how and when web fonts load to prevent layout shifts and invisible text, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
