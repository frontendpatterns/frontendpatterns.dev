# Font Loading Strategy

## Problem

Text remains invisible for seconds while custom fonts download, leaving users staring at blank pages. Font swaps cause jarring layout shifts mid-read as text suddenly changes size. Slow font loading blocks all text rendering, making content inaccessible. Flash of unstyled text disrupts the visual experience as fonts load inconsistently.

## Solution

Apply the Font Loading Strategy pattern by controlling how and when web fonts load to prevent layout shifts and invisible text, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
