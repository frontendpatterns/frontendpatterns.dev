# Environment Configuration

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that configuring applications differently across development, staging, and production environments falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Environment Configuration pattern by configuring applications differently across development, staging, and production environments, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
