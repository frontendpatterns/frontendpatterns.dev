# Environment Configuration

## Problem

Configuration values are hardcoded or scattered throughout the codebase: API URLs, feature flags, and API keys mixed into application code. Deploying to different environments requires code changes, and accidentally using production credentials in development or vice versa causes dangerous mistakes and security risks.

## Solution

Configure applications differently across development, staging, and production environments. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
