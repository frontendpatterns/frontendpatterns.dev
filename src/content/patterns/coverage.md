# Coverage Strategy Pattern

Define meaningful code coverage targets that reflect actual risk areas.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that defining meaningful code coverage targets that reflect actual risk areas falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Coverage Strategy pattern by defining meaningful code coverage targets that reflect actual risk areas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
