# Coverage Strategy

## Problem

Teams chase 100% coverage on trivial code while ignoring critical paths, or have no coverage strategy at all. Coverage metrics become a checkbox exercise that doesn't correlate with actual confidence, allowing high-risk features to ship untested while trivial getters have full coverage.

## Solution

Apply the Coverage Strategy pattern by defining meaningful code coverage targets that reflect actual risk areas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
