# Context Testing

## Problem

Components that rely on context break when tested in isolation because the required context providers aren't available. Tests pass with mocked context values that don't match production, hiding bugs where components misuse or incorrectly consume context data.

## Solution

Verify that components correctly consume and provide context values. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
