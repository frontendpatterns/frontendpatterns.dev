# Context Testing

Verify that components correctly consume and provide context values.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that verifying that components correctly consume and provide context values falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Context Testing pattern by verifying that components correctly consume and provide context values, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
