# Form-Level Validation

Validate entire forms on submission to check cross-field rules and constraints.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that validating entire forms on submission to check cross-field rules and constraints falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Form-Level Validation pattern by validating entire forms on submission to check cross-field rules and constraints, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
