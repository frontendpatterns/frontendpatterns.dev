# Interface Definition

## Problem

Objects are passed around with implicit structures, making it unclear what properties exist or what types they should have. Developers access non-existent properties, mistype field names, and pass wrong data types, all without any compile-time warnings. Refactoring becomes dangerous because there's no way to track which code depends on specific object shapes.

## Solution

Describe object shapes with interfaces for documentation and type checking. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
