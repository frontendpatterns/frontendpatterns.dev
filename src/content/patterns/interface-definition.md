# Interface Definition

Describe object shapes with interfaces for documentation and type checking.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that describing object shapes with interfaces for documentation and type checking falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Interface Definition pattern by describing object shapes with interfaces for documentation and type checking, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
