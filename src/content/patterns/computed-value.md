# Computed Value

Derive values from state only when dependencies change rather than on every render.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that deriving values from state only when dependencies change rather than on every render falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Computed Value pattern by deriving values from state only when dependencies change rather than on every render, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
