# Bundle Size Monitoring

## Problem

JavaScript bundles grow unnoticed until users complain about slow load times. A single dependency addition can balloon bundle size by hundreds of kilobytes, but no one realizes until it's deployed. Performance degrades gradually with each release as dead code and duplicate dependencies accumulate.

## Solution

Track JavaScript bundle sizes over time to prevent performance regressions. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
