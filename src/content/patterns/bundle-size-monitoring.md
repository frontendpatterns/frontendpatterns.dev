# Bundle Size Monitoring

Track JavaScript bundle sizes over time to prevent performance regressions.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that tracking JavaScript bundle sizes over time to prevent performance regressions falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Bundle Size Monitoring pattern by tracking JavaScript bundle sizes over time to prevent performance regressions, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
