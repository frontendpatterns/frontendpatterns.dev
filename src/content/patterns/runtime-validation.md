# Runtime Validation

Validate data at runtime to ensure it matches expected schemas.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that validating data at runtime to ensure it matches expected schemas falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on type safety and contracts concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Runtime Validation pattern by validating data at runtime to ensure it matches expected schemas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
