# Runtime Validation

## Problem

Data from external sources like APIs, user input, or local storage is assumed to match expected types without verification. Invalid data crashes the application when accessed, causes silent bugs when used in calculations, or corrupts state when stored. TypeScript types provide no protection at runtime, allowing malformed data to flow through the system unchecked.

## Solution

Apply the Runtime Validation pattern by validating data at runtime to ensure it matches expected schemas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
