# Component Lifecycle

Manage setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that managing setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

Apply the Component Lifecycle pattern by managing setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, keep a `UserCard` component focused on presentation while a `useUserCard` hook fetches and normalizes its data.
