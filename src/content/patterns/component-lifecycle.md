# Component Lifecycle

## Problem

Event listeners accumulate without being removed, subscriptions leak memory, and API calls fire at the wrong time. Components that don't properly manage their lifecycle phases create performance issues, memory leaks, and race conditions where stale data overwrites fresh updates.

## Solution

Manage setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence. For example, keep a `UserCard` component focused on presentation while a data fetching layer fetches and normalizes its data.
