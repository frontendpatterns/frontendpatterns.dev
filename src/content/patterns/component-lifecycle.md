# Component Lifecycle Pattern

Manage setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that managing setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on component concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Component Lifecycle pattern by managing setup, updates, and cleanup phases of component existence, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, keep a `UserCard` component focused on presentation while a `useUserCard` hook fetches and normalizes its data.
