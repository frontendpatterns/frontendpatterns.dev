# Component Interface

## Problem

Components become fragile black boxes where it's unclear what props are required, what types they expect, or what they return. Changes to one component silently break others, and bugs only surface at runtime when users encounter "undefined is not a function" or receive malformed data.

## Solution

Apply the Component Interface pattern by defining clear contracts for component inputs and outputs, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
