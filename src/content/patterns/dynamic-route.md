# Dynamic Route

## Problem

Routes must be manually defined one by one, even when they follow predictable patterns based on data. Adding new content types or categories requires updating route configuration files, creating maintenance burden and tight coupling between data and routing code.

## Solution

Generate routes programmatically based on data or configuration. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
