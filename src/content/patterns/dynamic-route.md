# Dynamic Route

Generate routes programmatically based on data or configuration.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that generating routes programmatically based on data or configuration falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Dynamic Route pattern by generating routes programmatically based on data or configuration, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
