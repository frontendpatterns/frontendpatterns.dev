# Field-Level Validation Pattern

Validate individual form fields as users interact with them for immediate feedback.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that validating individual form fields as users interact with them for immediate feedback falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Field-Level Validation pattern by validating individual form fields as users interact with them for immediate feedback, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
