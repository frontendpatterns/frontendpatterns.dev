# CSS-in-JS

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that writing styles in JavaScript to enable dynamic styling and component co-location falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the CSS-in-JS pattern by writing styles in JavaScript to enable dynamic styling and component co-location, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
