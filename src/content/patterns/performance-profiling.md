# Performance Profiling

Use browser DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that using browser DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Performance Profiling pattern by using browser DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
