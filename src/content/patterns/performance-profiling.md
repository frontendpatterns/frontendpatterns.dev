# Performance Profiling

## Problem

Performance issues remain mysterious because developers lack visibility into what's slowing down the application. Users report sluggishness but the root cause is unclear. Memory leaks accumulate over time, degrading performance until the tab crashes. Optimization efforts are guesswork without data showing where time is actually spent.

## Solution

Apply the Performance Profiling pattern by using browser DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
