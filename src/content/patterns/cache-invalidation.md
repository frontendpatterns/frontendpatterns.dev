# Cache Invalidation

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that strategically clearing or updating cached data when underlying information changes falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Cache Invalidation pattern by strategically clearing or updating cached data when underlying information changes, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
