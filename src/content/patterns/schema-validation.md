# Schema Validation

Use libraries like Zod, Yup, or JSON Schema to validate data against schemas.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that using libraries like Zod, Yup, or JSON Schema to validate data against schemas falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on type safety and contracts concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Schema Validation pattern by using libraries like Zod, Yup, or JSON Schema to validate data against schemas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
