# Schema Validation

## Problem

Runtime validation is hand-written with manual type guards, creating verbose boilerplate that's error-prone and hard to maintain. Validation logic and TypeScript types diverge over time because they're defined separately, leading to mismatches between runtime checks and compile-time types. Complex nested objects require deeply nested validation code that's difficult to read and test.

## Solution

Apply the Schema Validation pattern by using libraries like Zod, Yup, or JSON Schema to validate data against schemas, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
