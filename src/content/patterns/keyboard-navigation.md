# Keyboard Navigation

## Problem

Keyboard users get trapped in modal dialogs or can't reach interactive elements. Custom dropdowns, accordions, and menus ignore Tab key navigation. Power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts are forced to use a mouse, significantly slowing them down.

## Solution

Apply the Keyboard Navigation pattern by supporting full keyboard interaction for users who can't or don't use pointing devices, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
