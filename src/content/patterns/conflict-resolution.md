# Conflict Resolution

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that handling concurrent updates and data conflicts in distributed systems with last-write-wins, operational transforms, or CRDTs falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Conflict Resolution pattern by handling concurrent updates and data conflicts in distributed systems with last-write-wins, operational transforms, or CRDTs, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
