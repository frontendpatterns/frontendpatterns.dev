# Conflict Resolution

## Problem

When multiple users edit the same data simultaneously, their changes can conflict. The last update might silently overwrite earlier changes, causing data loss and frustrating users who see their work disappear. In collaborative applications like document editors or real-time dashboards, you need a strategy to merge concurrent updates or notify users when conflicts occur.

## Solution

Apply the Conflict Resolution pattern by handling concurrent updates and data conflicts in distributed systems with last-write-wins, operational transforms, or CRDTs, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
