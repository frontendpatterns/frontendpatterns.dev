# Design Token

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that defining visual design decisions as reusable variables for consistency across platforms falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Design Token pattern by defining visual design decisions as reusable variables for consistency across platforms, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
