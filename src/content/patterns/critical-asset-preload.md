# Critical Asset Preload Pattern

Instruct browsers to prioritize loading essential resources for faster initial renders.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that instructing browsers to prioritize loading essential resources for faster initial renders falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on performance concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Critical Asset Preload pattern by instructing browsers to prioritize loading essential resources for faster initial renders, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
