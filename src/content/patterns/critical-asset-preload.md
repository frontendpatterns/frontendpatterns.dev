# Critical Asset Preload

## Problem

Critical fonts, stylesheets, and scripts load too late because browsers discover them only after parsing HTML. The page flashes unstyled content while essential CSS downloads. Above-the-fold content can't render because key resources aren't prioritized. Browsers waste time downloading low-priority assets while critical ones wait in the queue.

## Solution

Apply the Critical Asset Preload pattern by instructing browsers to prioritize loading essential resources for faster initial renders, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
