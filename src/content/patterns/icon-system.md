# Icon System

## Problem

Icons are scattered across the codebase as individual image files, inline SVGs copied and pasted with inconsistent sizes and colors, or multiple icon libraries loaded simultaneously. Changing an icon requires finding all instances, designers struggle to maintain visual consistency, and bundle sizes bloat with duplicate icon code and unused glyphs.

## Solution

Apply the Icon System pattern by managing icons as a cohesive system using SVG sprites, icon fonts, or component libraries, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
