# Icon System

Manage icons as a cohesive system using SVG sprites, icon fonts, or component libraries.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that managing icons as a cohesive system using SVG sprites, icon fonts, or component libraries falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Icon System pattern by managing icons as a cohesive system using SVG sprites, icon fonts, or component libraries, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
