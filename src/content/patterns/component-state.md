# Component State

Manage data that only affects a single component internally.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that managing data that only affects a single component internally falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Component State pattern by managing data that only affects a single component internally, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
