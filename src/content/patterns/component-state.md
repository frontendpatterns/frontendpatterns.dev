# Component State

## Problem

Local UI state like toggle visibility, form input values, or hover states gets lifted into global stores or prop-drilled through multiple layers, creating unnecessary complexity. Simple interactions become tangled with application-wide state management, making components harder to reuse and test.

## Solution

Apply the Component State pattern by managing data that only affects a single component internally, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
