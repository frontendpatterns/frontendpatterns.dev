# Documentation as Code

## Problem

Documentation lives in separate wikis, Google Docs, or Confluence pages that quickly become outdated. When code changes, documentation doesn't, leaving developers with inaccurate guides that waste time and cause confusion. There's no easy way to review documentation changes alongside code changes or ensure they stay in sync.

## Solution

Maintain documentation alongside code with version control and automated publishing workflows. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
