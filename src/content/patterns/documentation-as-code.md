# Documentation as Code

Maintain documentation alongside code with version control and automated publishing workflows.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that maintaining documentation alongside code with version control and automated publishing workflows falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Documentation as Code pattern by maintaining documentation alongside code with version control and automated publishing workflows, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
