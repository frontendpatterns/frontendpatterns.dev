# Theme Provider

## Problem

Each component fetches and manages its own theme values, leading to duplicated theme logic and inconsistent colors when some components miss theme updates. Implementing dark mode or allowing users to switch themes requires modifying every component individually, and there's no single source of truth for the current theme state.

## Solution

Apply the Theme Provider pattern by centralizing design tokens and enabling runtime theme switching across an application, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
