# Theme Provider

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that centralizing design tokens and enabling runtime theme switching across an application falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Theme Provider pattern by centralizing design tokens and enabling runtime theme switching across an application, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
