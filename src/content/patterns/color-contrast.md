# Color Contrast

Ensure sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds for readability.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that ensuring sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds for readability falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on accessibility concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Color Contrast pattern by ensuring sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds for readability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
