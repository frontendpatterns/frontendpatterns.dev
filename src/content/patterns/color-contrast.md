# Color Contrast

## Problem

Users with low vision or color blindness can't read text against backgrounds with insufficient contrast. Light gray text on white backgrounds, or subtle color variations become invisible to many users, making content inaccessible regardless of how well-written it is.

## Solution

Apply the Color Contrast pattern by ensuring sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds for readability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
