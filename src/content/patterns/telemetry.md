# Telemetry

## Problem

Product decisions are based on guesses rather than data. Teams don't know which features users actually use, where performance bottlenecks occur, or what errors users encounter. When bugs are reported, there's no diagnostic data to understand what went wrong, making issues difficult to reproduce and fix.

## Solution

Collect usage analytics and performance metrics to inform product decisions. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
