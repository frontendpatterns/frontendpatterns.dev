# Retry

## Problem

Temporary network blips or server timeouts immediately show error messages to users. Operations that could succeed if retried force users to manually refresh or try again. Transient failures get treated as permanent errors, degrading the user experience during normal internet hiccups.

## Solution

Automatically re-attempting failed requests with exponential backoff strategies. For example, let a data fetching layer own the network call while a table component simply renders rows.
