# Retry

## Problem

Temporary network blips or server timeouts immediately show error messages to users. Operations that could succeed if retried force users to manually refresh or try again. Transient failures get treated as permanent errors, degrading the user experience during normal internet hiccups.

## Solution

Apply the Retry pattern by automatically re-attempting failed requests with exponential backoff strategies, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
