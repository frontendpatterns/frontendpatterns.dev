# REST Response Normalization

Transform nested API responses into flat, relational structures for efficient updates.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that transforming nested API responses into flat, relational structures for efficient updates falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the REST Response Normalization pattern by transforming nested API responses into flat, relational structures for efficient updates, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
