# Single Store

## Problem

State scattered across multiple locations makes it impossible to understand the full application state at any given time. Debugging requires checking countless component instances and context providers. Time-travel debugging and state persistence become impractical. Coordinating updates across different state containers leads to race conditions and inconsistent UI.

## Solution

Centralize all application state in one location for predictable updates. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
