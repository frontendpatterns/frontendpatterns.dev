# Style Isolation

## Problem

Styles from one component unexpectedly affect others, causing buttons in a modal to inherit card styles or global typography rules to break specific components. Third-party widgets clash with app styles, and developers spend hours debugging why a simple CSS change breaks layouts in different parts of the application.

## Solution

Prevent style leakage between components through encapsulation techniques. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
