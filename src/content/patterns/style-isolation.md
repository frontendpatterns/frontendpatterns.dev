# Style Isolation Pattern

Prevent style leakage between components through encapsulation techniques.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that preventing style leakage between components through encapsulation techniques falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on styling concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Style Isolation pattern by preventing style leakage between components through encapsulation techniques, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
