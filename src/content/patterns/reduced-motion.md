# Reduced Motion

## Problem

Users with motion sensitivity experience nausea or dizziness from animations. Parallax scrolling or auto-playing animations can make interfaces completely unusable for people with vestibular disorders. Users have set a system preference to reduce motion, but websites ignore it, causing physical discomfort.

## Solution

Respect user preferences for reduced animations and motion effects. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
