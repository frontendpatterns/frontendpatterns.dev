# Structured Logging

## Problem

Logs are inconsistent plain text with no structure: different formats, missing context, and no way to filter or search effectively. When production issues occur, developers grep through thousands of unstructured log lines trying to piece together what happened. Critical information like user IDs, request IDs, or error codes are buried in freeform text.

## Solution

Apply the Structured Logging pattern by implementing consistent, searchable logging for production debugging and monitoring, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
