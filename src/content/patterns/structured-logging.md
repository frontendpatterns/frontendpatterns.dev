# Structured Logging

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that implementing consistent, searchable logging for production debugging and monitoring falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Structured Logging pattern by implementing consistent, searchable logging for production debugging and monitoring, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
