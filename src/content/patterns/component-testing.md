# Component Testing

Test components in isolation to verify their behavior and output.

## Problem

Components break in subtle ways that only appear in production. Developers manually click through the UI repeatedly to verify changes, wasting hours on repetitive testing. Regression bugs slip through because there's no automated verification that components render correctly or handle user interactions properly.

## Solution

Apply the Component Testing pattern by testing components in isolation to verify their behavior and output, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
