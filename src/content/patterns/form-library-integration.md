# Form Library Integration

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that leveraging third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Form Library Integration pattern by leveraging third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
