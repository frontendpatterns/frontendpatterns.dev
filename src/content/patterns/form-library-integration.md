# Form Library Integration Pattern

Leverage third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that leveraging third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Form Library Integration pattern by leveraging third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
