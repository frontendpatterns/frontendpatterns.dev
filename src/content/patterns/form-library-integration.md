# Form Library Integration

## Problem

Form state becomes tangled with component rendering, making it difficult to validate, reset, or debug. Complex forms with conditional fields and multi-step flows become unmaintainable. Custom validation logic is scattered across components, leading to inconsistent error handling and duplicate code.

## Solution

Leverage third-party form libraries to handle complex validation and submission logic. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
