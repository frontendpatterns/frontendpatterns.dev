# Barrel Export

Aggregate multiple exports into a single entry point using index files to create clean public APIs and simplify import paths.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that aggregating multiple exports into a single entry point using index files to create clean public APIs and simplify import paths falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on project structure concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Barrel Export pattern by aggregating multiple exports into a single entry point using index files to create clean public APIs and simplify import paths, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, split a billing feature so API clients, hooks, and UI elements live in distinct folders with explicit boundaries.
