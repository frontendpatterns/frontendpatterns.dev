# Folder Organization Strategy

## Problem

The project structure is either too flat with hundreds of files in one directory, making it impossible to find anything, or too deeply nested with excessive folders that force developers to navigate through many levels to reach a single file. Both extremes slow down development and make the codebase harder to navigate.

## Solution

Choose between shallow folder structures for simplicity or deep nesting for organization based on project scale. For example, split a billing feature so API clients, data fetching logic, and UI elements live in distinct folders with explicit boundaries.
