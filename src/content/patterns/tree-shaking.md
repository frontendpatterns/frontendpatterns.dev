# Tree Shaking

Eliminate unused code from bundles during the build process.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that eliminating unused code from bundles during the build process falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Tree Shaking pattern by eliminating unused code from bundles during the build process, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
