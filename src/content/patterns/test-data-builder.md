# Test Data Builder

## Problem

Test data setup becomes verbose and brittle when each test manually constructs complex objects. When a required field is added, dozens of tests break. Tests become hard to read because most of the data is irrelevant boilerplate, obscuring what the test is actually verifying.

## Solution

Create reusable factories for generating test data with sensible defaults. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
