# Test Data Builder

## Problem

Test data setup becomes verbose and brittle when each test manually constructs complex objects. When a required field is added, dozens of tests break. Tests become hard to read because most of the data is irrelevant boilerplate, obscuring what the test is actually verifying.

## Solution

Apply the Test Data Builder pattern by creating reusable factories for generating test data with sensible defaults, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
