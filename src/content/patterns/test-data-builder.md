# Test Data Builder

Create reusable factories for generating test data with sensible defaults.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that creating reusable factories for generating test data with sensible defaults falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on testing concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Test Data Builder pattern by creating reusable factories for generating test data with sensible defaults, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
