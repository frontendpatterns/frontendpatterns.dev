# Memoization

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that caching expensive computation results to avoid recalculating with identical inputs falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Memoization pattern by caching expensive computation results to avoid recalculating with identical inputs, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
