# Flux

Implement unidirectional data flow architecture with actions, dispatchers, stores, and views.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that unidirectional data flow architecture with actions, dispatchers, stores, and views falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Flux pattern by unidirectional data flow architecture with actions, dispatchers, stores, and views, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
