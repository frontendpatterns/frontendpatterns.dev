# Flux

Implement unidirectional data flow architecture with actions, dispatchers, stores, and views.

## Problem

Bidirectional data flow creates unpredictable update cycles where views update models, models update other models, and the cascade becomes impossible to trace. State changes can come from anywhere, making bugs hard to reproduce. Multiple components directly mutating shared data leads to race conditions and inconsistent UI state across the application.

## Solution

Apply the Flux pattern by unidirectional data flow architecture with actions, dispatchers, stores, and views, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
