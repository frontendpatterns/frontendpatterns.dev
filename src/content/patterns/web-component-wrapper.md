# Web Component Wrapper

## Problem

Design systems built in one framework can't be used in applications built with different frameworks. Teams are forced to rebuild the same components multiple times or lock into a single framework. Migrating from one framework to another requires rewriting every component, making incremental migration impossible.

## Solution

Apply the Web Component Wrapper pattern by wrapping framework components as web components for cross-framework interoperability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
