# Web Component Wrapper Pattern

Wrap framework components as web components for cross-framework interoperability.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that wrapping framework components as web components for cross-framework interoperability falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Web Component Wrapper pattern by wrapping framework components as web components for cross-framework interoperability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
