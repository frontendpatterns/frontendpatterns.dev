# Web Component Wrapper

## Problem

Design systems built in one framework can't be used in applications built with different frameworks. Teams are forced to rebuild the same components multiple times or lock into a single framework. Migrating from one framework to another requires rewriting every component, making incremental migration impossible.

## Solution

Wrap framework components as web components for cross-framework interoperability. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
