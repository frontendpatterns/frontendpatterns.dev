# Utility-First CSS

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that building interfaces using small, single-purpose utility classes rather than semantic class names falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Utility-First CSS pattern by building interfaces using small, single-purpose utility classes rather than semantic class names, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
