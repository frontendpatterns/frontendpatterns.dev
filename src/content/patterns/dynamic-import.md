# Dynamic Import Pattern

Load modules asynchronously at runtime rather than bundling everything upfront.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that loading modules asynchronously at runtime rather than bundling everything upfront falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on performance concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Dynamic Import pattern by loading modules asynchronously at runtime rather than bundling everything upfront, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
