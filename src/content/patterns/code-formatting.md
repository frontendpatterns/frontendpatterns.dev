# Code Formatting Pattern

Format code automatically to eliminate style debates and merge conflicts.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that automatically formatting code to eliminate style debates and merge conflicts falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Code Formatting pattern by automatically formatting code to eliminate style debates and merge conflicts, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
