# Code Formatting

## Problem

Code style is inconsistent across the codebase, causing merge conflicts and wasted time in code reviews debating formatting. Different developers use different indentation, quote styles, or bracket placement, making diffs noisy and harder to review for meaningful changes.

## Solution

Apply the Code Formatting pattern by automatically formatting code to eliminate style debates and merge conflicts, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
