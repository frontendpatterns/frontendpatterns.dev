# State Synchronization

Keep component state in sync with external data sources or other components.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that keeping component state in sync with external data sources or other components falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the State Synchronization pattern by keeping component state in sync with external data sources or other components, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
