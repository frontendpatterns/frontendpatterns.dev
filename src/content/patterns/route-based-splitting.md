# Route-Based Splitting

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that automatically splitting code at route boundaries for natural loading chunks falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Route-Based Splitting pattern by automatically splitting code at route boundaries for natural loading chunks, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
