# Contract Testing

Verify that components and APIs adhere to their defined interfaces.

## Problem

Frontend and backend teams evolve interfaces independently, causing runtime failures when APIs change. Components expect fields that no longer exist, or type mismatches between what the API returns and what the frontend expects go undetected until production.

## Solution

Apply the Contract Testing pattern by verifying that components and APIs adhere to their defined interfaces, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
