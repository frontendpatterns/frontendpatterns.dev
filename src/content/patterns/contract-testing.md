# Contract Testing

Verify that components and APIs adhere to their defined interfaces.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that verifying that components and APIs adhere to their defined interfaces falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Contract Testing pattern by verifying that components and APIs adhere to their defined interfaces, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
