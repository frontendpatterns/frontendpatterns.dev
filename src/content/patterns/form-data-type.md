# Form Data Type

## Problem

Form data flows through validation, transformation, and submission logic with inconsistent types. Required fields get forgotten, validation rules drift from actual requirements, and submission payloads silently fail due to type mismatches. Refactoring forms is risky because there's no compile-time safety.

## Solution

Strongly type form data structures to prevent validation errors. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
