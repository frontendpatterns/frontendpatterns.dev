# Form Data Type

Type form data structures strongly to prevent validation errors.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that strongly typing form data structures to prevent validation errors falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Form Data Type pattern by strongly typing form data structures to prevent validation errors, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
