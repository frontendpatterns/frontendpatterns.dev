# Form Data Type Pattern

Type form data structures strongly to prevent validation errors.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that strongly typing form data structures to prevent validation errors falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on type safety and contracts concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Form Data Type pattern by strongly typing form data structures to prevent validation errors, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
