# A/B Testing Pattern

Run controlled experiments to compare different implementations and measure impact.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that running controlled experiments to compare different implementations and measure impact falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the A/B Testing pattern by running controlled experiments to compare different implementations and measure impact, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
