# A/B Testing

## Problem

Teams often make product changes based on intuition or assumptions rather than data, leading to unclear outcomes and disagreements about what 'better' means. Without controlled experiments, it's impossible to know whether a redesign actually improves conversions or if a performance optimization truly helps users.

## Solution

Run controlled experiments to compare different implementations and measure impact. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
