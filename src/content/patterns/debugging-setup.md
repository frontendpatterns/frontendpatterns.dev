# Debugging Setup

## Problem

Developers waste hours adding console.log statements, refreshing browsers, and manually recreating bug conditions. Without proper debugging tools and breakpoints configured, tracking down issues becomes a tedious guessing game of print statements and trial-and-error.

## Solution

Set up debugging tools and breakpoints for efficient problem solving. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
