# Debugging Setup Pattern

Set up debugging tools and breakpoints for efficient problem solving.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that setting up debugging tools and breakpoints for efficient problem solving falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on developer experience concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Debugging Setup pattern by setting up debugging tools and breakpoints for efficient problem solving, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, add a lint rule that rejects feature-flag commits without the cleanup task attached.
