# API Schema

## Problem

Backend changes silently break frontend code because there's no contract enforcement. Runtime errors appear in production when API fields are renamed, types change, or required fields become optional. Mock data and tests use different shapes than actual API responses, making bugs hard to catch until production deployment.

## Solution

Apply the API Schema pattern by defining and enforcing contracts for API request and response structures, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
