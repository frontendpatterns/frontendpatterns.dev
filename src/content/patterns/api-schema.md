# API Schema

Define and enforcing contracts for API request and response structures.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that defining and enforcing contracts for API request and response structures falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the API Schema pattern by defining and enforcing contracts for API request and response structures, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
