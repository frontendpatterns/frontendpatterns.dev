# API Schema

## Problem

Backend changes silently break frontend code because there's no contract enforcement. Runtime errors appear in production when API fields are renamed, types change, or required fields become optional. Mock data and tests use different shapes than actual API responses, making bugs hard to catch until production deployment.

## Solution

Define and enforce contracts for API request and response structures. For example, share a TypeScript interface between the API client and the `OrderSummary` component so breaking changes fail fast.
