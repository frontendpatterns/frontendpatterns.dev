# State Reducer Pattern

Use reducer functions to handle complex state transitions with predictable logic.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that using reducer functions to handle complex state transitions with predictable logic falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on state management concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the State Reducer pattern by using reducer functions to handle complex state transitions with predictable logic, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
