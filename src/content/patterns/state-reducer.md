# State Reducer

## Problem

Complex state transitions scattered across multiple state declarations become impossible to reason about. Related state updates happen in different event handlers, leading to impossible states and race conditions. Debugging state changes requires hunting through numerous state update calls, and there's no single source of truth for what transitions are valid.

## Solution

Use reducer functions to handle complex state transitions with predictable logic. For example, separate a cart totals reducer from modal visibility state so analytics remains deterministic.
