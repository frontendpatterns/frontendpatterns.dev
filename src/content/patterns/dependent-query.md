# Dependent Query

## Problem

Components attempt to fetch data before required information is available, causing errors or null reference exceptions. Fetching user preferences before knowing the user ID, or loading order details before getting the order number results in failed requests. Developers manually coordinate request timing with complex conditional logic and lifecycle dependencies.

## Solution

Chain API requests where subsequent calls depend on previous results. For example, let a data fetching layer own the network call while a table component simply renders rows.
