# Dependent Query

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that chaining API requests where subsequent calls depend on previous results falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Dependent Query pattern by chaining API requests where subsequent calls depend on previous results, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
