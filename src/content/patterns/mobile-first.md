# Mobile-First

## Problem

Desktop-first designs require stripping away features and cramming content for mobile, resulting in awkward layouts and hidden functionality. Media queries become complex override chains attempting to undo desktop styles, and mobile users receive a degraded experience as an afterthought rather than a first-class design consideration.

## Solution

Apply the Mobile-First pattern by designing for small screens first, then progressively enhancing for larger viewports, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, isolate a `Button` component's look with scoped classes while brand tokens stay in a shared theme file.
