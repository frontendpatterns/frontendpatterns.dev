# Compound Component

Create components that work together implicitly through shared context to manage complex interactions.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that creating components that work together implicitly through shared context to manage complex interactions falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Compound Component pattern by creating components that work together implicitly through shared context to manage complex interactions, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, keep a `UserCard` component focused on presentation while a `useUserCard` hook fetches and normalizes its data.
