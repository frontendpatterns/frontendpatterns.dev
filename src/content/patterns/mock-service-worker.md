# Mock Service Worker

## Problem

Traditional API mocking requires duplicating mock logic between tests and development, tightly coupling tests to implementation details. Mocks that stub at the function level miss entire layers of the network stack, failing to catch serialization bugs, CORS issues, or incorrect request headers.

## Solution

Intercept network requests at the service worker level for realistic testing. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
