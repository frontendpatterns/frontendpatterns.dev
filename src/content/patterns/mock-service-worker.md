# Mock Service Worker

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that intercepting network requests at the service worker level for realistic testing falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Mock Service Worker pattern by intercepting network requests at the service worker level for realistic testing, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
