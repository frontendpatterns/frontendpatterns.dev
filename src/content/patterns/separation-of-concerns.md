# Separation of Concerns

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that dividing code into distinct sections for logic, presentation, and styling to improve maintainability falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Separation of Concerns pattern by dividing code into distinct sections for logic, presentation, and styling to improve maintainability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, split a billing feature so API clients, hooks, and UI elements live in distinct folders with explicit boundaries.
