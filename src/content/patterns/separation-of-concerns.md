# Separation of Concerns Pattern

Divide code into distinct sections for logic, presentation, and styling to improve maintainability.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that dividing code into distinct sections for logic, presentation, and styling to improve maintainability falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on project structure concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Separation of Concerns pattern by dividing code into distinct sections for logic, presentation, and styling to improve maintainability, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, split a billing feature so API clients, hooks, and UI elements live in distinct folders with explicit boundaries.
