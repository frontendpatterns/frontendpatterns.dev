# Client-Side Routing

Handle navigation without full page reloads for seamless single-page application experiences.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that handling navigation without full page reloads for seamless single-page application experiences falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Client-Side Routing pattern by handling navigation without full page reloads for seamless single-page application experiences, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
