# Client-Side Routing

## Problem

Every navigation reloads the entire page, destroying application state and causing jarring white flashes. Users lose their place in forms, scroll positions reset, and interactive features restart from scratch. The experience feels slow and broken compared to native applications.

## Solution

Apply the Client-Side Routing pattern by handling navigation without full page reloads for seamless single-page application experiences, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
