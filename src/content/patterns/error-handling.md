# Error Handling

## Problem

Failed API requests leave users staring at loading spinners indefinitely or crash components with unhandled promise rejections. There's no consistent way to show error messages, retry failed requests, or gracefully degrade functionality when backend services are unavailable.

## Solution

Apply the Error Handling pattern by gracefully managing and displaying errors from failed API requests, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
