# Error Handling

## Problem

Failed API requests leave users staring at loading spinners indefinitely or crash components with unhandled promise rejections. There's no consistent way to show error messages, retry failed requests, or gracefully degrade functionality when backend services are unavailable.

## Solution

Gracefully manage and display errors from failed API requests. For example, let a data fetching layer own the network call while a table component simply renders rows.
