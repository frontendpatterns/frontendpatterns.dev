# Error Handling Pattern

Manage and displaying errors gracefully from failed API requests.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that gracefully managing and displaying errors from failed API requests falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on data fetching concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Error Handling pattern by gracefully managing and displaying errors from failed API requests, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, let a `useOrders` hook own the network call while an `OrdersTable` component simply renders rows.
