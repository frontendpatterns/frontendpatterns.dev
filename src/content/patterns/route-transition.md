# Route Transition

Animate between route changes for polished user experiences.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that animating between route changes for polished user experiences falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on routing and navigation concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Route Transition pattern by animating between route changes for polished user experiences, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
