# Route Transition

## Problem

Navigation feels abrupt and jarring, with content instantly swapping out without visual continuity. Users lose spatial awareness of where they are in the application as pages suddenly appear and disappear. The experience feels mechanical rather than fluid.

## Solution

Animate between route changes for polished user experiences. For example, map `/settings/profile` and `/settings/security` to nested layouts so URLs mirror what users see.
