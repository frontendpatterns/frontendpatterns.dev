# Error Boundary

## Problem

Uncaught JavaScript errors crash the entire React app, leaving users with a blank white screen and no explanation. A single broken component can take down an entire page, even when 95% of the functionality is working fine, with no way to recover or show a helpful error message.

## Solution

Apply the Error Boundary pattern by catching JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UI gracefully, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
