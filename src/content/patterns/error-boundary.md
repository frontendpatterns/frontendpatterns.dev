# Error Boundary

## Problem

Uncaught JavaScript errors crash the entire application, leaving users with a blank white screen and no explanation. A single broken component can take down an entire page, even when 95% of the functionality is working fine, with no way to recover or show a helpful error message.

## Solution

Catch JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UI gracefully. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
