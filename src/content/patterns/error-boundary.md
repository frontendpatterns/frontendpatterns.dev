# Error Boundary

Catch JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UI gracefully.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that catching JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UI gracefully falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on performance concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the Error Boundary pattern by catching JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UI gracefully, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, memoize the transformed dataset before rendering a 500-row analytics grid so scrolling stays smooth.
