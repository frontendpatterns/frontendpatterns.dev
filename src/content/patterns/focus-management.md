# Focus Management

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that controlling focus flow for modal dialogs, route changes, and dynamic content insertion falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Focus Management pattern by controlling focus flow for modal dialogs, route changes, and dynamic content insertion, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, wire a modal so focus jumps to the primary action and returns to the trigger when it closes.
