# PII Redaction

## Problem

Sensitive user data like emails, phone numbers, credit card details, and social security numbers leak into error logs, analytics platforms, and monitoring tools. This creates privacy violations, GDPR non-compliance, and security risks when logging systems are breached or accessed by unauthorized personnel.

## Solution

Systematically remove or mask personally identifiable information from logs, analytics, and error reports. For example, lock down the marketing-site CSP so injected scripts can't touch dashboard session cookies.
