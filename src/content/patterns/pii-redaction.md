# PII Redaction

Remove or mask personally identifiable information systematically from logs, analytics, and error reports.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that systematically removing or masking personally identifiable information from logs, analytics, and error reports falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Context

Use it whenever you're working on security and privacy concerns in a codebase that multiple engineers touch daily.

## Solution

Apply the PII Redaction pattern by systematically removing or masking personally identifiable information from logs, analytics, and error reports, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, lock down the marketing-site CSP so injected scripts can't touch dashboard session cookies.
