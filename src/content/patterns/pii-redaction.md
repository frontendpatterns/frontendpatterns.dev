# PII Redaction

Remove or mask personally identifiable information systematically from logs, analytics, and error reports.

## Problem

Sensitive user data like emails, phone numbers, credit card details, and social security numbers leak into error logs, analytics platforms, and monitoring tools. This creates privacy violations, GDPR non-compliance, and security risks when logging systems are breached or accessed by unauthorized personnel.

## Solution

Apply the PII Redaction pattern by systematically removing or masking personally identifiable information from logs, analytics, and error reports, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, lock down the marketing-site CSP so injected scripts can't touch dashboard session cookies.
