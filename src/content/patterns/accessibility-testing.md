# Accessibility Testing

Verify that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards.

## Problem

Accessibility violations ship to production because manual testing with screen readers is time-consuming and easy to skip. Missing alt text, poor color contrast, keyboard traps, and ARIA errors exclude users with disabilities and create legal compliance risks.

## Solution

Apply the Accessibility Testing pattern by verifying that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
