# Accessibility Testing

## Problem

Accessibility violations ship to production because manual testing with screen readers is time-consuming and easy to skip. Missing alt text, poor color contrast, keyboard traps, and ARIA errors exclude users with disabilities and create legal compliance risks.

## Solution

Verify that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
