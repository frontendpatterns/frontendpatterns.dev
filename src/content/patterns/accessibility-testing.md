# Accessibility Testing

Verify that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards.

## Problem

Without this pattern, the premise that verifying that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards falls apart, and small changes trigger cascading regressions.

## Solution

Apply the Accessibility Testing pattern by verifying that interfaces work with assistive technologies and meet WCAG standards, and reinforce it with concise examples or tests. For example, run an integration test that fills the checkout form, submits it, and asserts on the rendered receipt.
