# Frontend Observability and Diagnostics

Shipping code is the easy part; sustaining reliability requires understanding how the app behaves in the wild. Observability closes the gap between bug reports and root cause analysis. This guide shows how to combine logging, telemetry, profiling, and coverage so teams see issues before users do.

## Establish Telemetry Foundations

- Instrument key user journeys with the [Telemetry](/telemetry) pattern. Capture page views, interactions, and Core Web Vitals so you watch both usage and quality.
- Standardize naming conventions for events and properties. Align analytics with product metrics like activation or retention to keep reports actionable.
- Send telemetry through privacy aware pipelines. Respect consent preferences and redact personal data at the source.

## Tell the Story with Structured Logs

- Adopt [Structured Logging](/structured-logging) to emit JSON logs from the client. Include correlation IDs that match server logs so you can trace full request paths.
- Log lifecycle events when components mount, hydrate, or fail. Avoid dumping every action; focus on signals that help triage incidents.
- Route logs to centralized storage with retention policies. Rotate API keys and monitor ingestion quotas to avoid losing visibility during traffic spikes.

## Capture Performance Signals

- Use [Performance Profiling](/performance-profiling) during development to find slow renders, expensive effects, and large bundles. Share flame charts in pull requests when refactoring critical paths.
- Extend profiling to production via sampling. Record long tasks and memory usage for a subset of sessions, then analyze regressions per release.
- Feed profiling insights back into performance budgets and status dashboards so stakeholders see how improvements translate into real gains.

## Keep Testing Signals Honest

- Track unit and integration code paths with the [Coverage](/coverage) pattern. Focus on meaningful thresholds for critical modules rather than a single repo-wide number.
- Combine coverage with analytics to spot blind spots. If a journey drives revenue but has poor coverage, prioritize new tests before adding features.

## Build a Debug-Ready Setup

- Follow the [Debugging Setup](/debugging-setup) pattern to standardize source maps, error boundaries, and console tooling across environments.
- Automate error reporting with stack traces that stay readable in every build (development, staging, production). Tie reports to git SHAs so engineers jump straight to the relevant commit.
- Maintain checklists for common scenarios, such as catching hydration mismatches or replaying user sessions. Share them widely so on-call engineers are never starting from scratch.

## Create Feedback Loops

- Review observability dashboards weekly with engineering and product leads. Celebrate improvements and assign owners for brewing issues.
- Run post-incident reviews that highlight how telemetry, logs, or profiling either helped or could have helped. Iterate on instrumentation based on those learnings.
- Train new engineers on the tooling as part of onboarding. Observability only works when every team member trusts and uses the signals.

When instrumentation, logging, and debugging practices align, teams resolve issues faster and ship confidently. Observability turns production from a black hole into a feedback engine that guides every release.
