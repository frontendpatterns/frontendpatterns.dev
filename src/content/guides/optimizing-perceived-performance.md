# Optimizing Perceived Performance

Perception often matters more than raw milliseconds. Even when a network call takes time, you can keep users confident by showing progress, prioritizing critical assets, and smoothing navigation. This guide outlines a layered approach that turns slow moments into seamless experiences.

## Understand Your Experience Budget

- Define target metrics for first contentful paint, time to interactive, and interaction latency on the devices your users actually own.
- Watch session replays or field data to identify abandonment moments. If users drop off during checkout between steps, route prefetching and skeleton states should focus there first.
- Track resource waterfalls for popular pages. Long gaps before CSS, fonts, or API responses arrive give you concrete candidates for [Critical Asset Preload](/critical-asset-preload) or optimized sizing.

## Prioritize the Above-the-Fold

- Use [Critical Asset Preload](/critical-asset-preload) to load key stylesheets, hero images, and web fonts early. Combine hints like `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` through the [Resource Hint](/resource-hint) pattern so browsers prepare the pipe before you even send a request.
- Audit bundle composition. If a marketing hero needs only a fraction of your design system, split the rest into async chunks to keep the first render focused.

## Show Progression During Waits

- Implement [Skeleton Loading](/skeleton-loading) components for areas with longer data fetches. Match the structure of the eventual content so layout shifts are minimal when real data arrives.
- When real images replace placeholders, pair skeletons with [Progressive Image](/progressive-image) techniques: serve lightweight blur previews, then swap to high fidelity versions without flashing.
- For actions that mutate data, combine skeletons with optimistic UI to keep users engaged while you reconcile responses in the background.

## Keep Navigation Instant

- Adopt [Route Prefetching](/route-prefetching) to warm up data and bundles for the next route users are likely to visit. Prefetch on viewport when a link becomes visible or on hover for desktop interactions.
- Align prefetch rules with analytics. Prefetch routes that represent the primary funnel, and skip rarely used admin pages to save bandwidth.
- Use [Resource Hint](/resource-hint) APIs like `prefetch` and `preload` in tandem with router level strategies so the browser receives consistent signals.

## Monitor and Tune Continuously

- Wire performance budgets into CI. If bundle size or largest contentful paint regresses, block the merge and point engineers toward remediation.
- Capture Core Web Vitals through real user monitoring. Tie metrics back to releases so you know which change impacted perception and what to roll back or iterate.
- Review placeholders in design critiques. Skeletons should communicate progress, not distract users with animation loops that feel broken.

Perceived performance is a team sport that spans design, engineering, and infrastructure. By combining these patterns, you keep experiences feeling instant even when the network is not.
