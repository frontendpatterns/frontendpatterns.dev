# Securing Frontend Data Flows

Attackers target the browser because it sits closest to the user, handles sensitive tokens, and renders whatever data the server returns. This guide walks through the layered safeguards that keep cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and supply chain attacks out of your UI while preserving developer velocity.

## Map Your Surfaces

- Inventory every way data enters the app, including form inputs, query parameters, CMS content, and third-party scripts. Flag routes that mix untrusted data with privileged capabilities such as billing or admin dashboards.
- Trace user journeys where cookies or local storage hold session data, since these flows demand both [CSRF Protection](/csrf-protection) and controlled rendering sinks.
- Document whether responses are static, server rendered, or hydrated on the client. Hydrated components often add ad hoc `innerHTML` escapes, which are riskier than centralized strategies like [Trusted Types](/trusted-types).

## Build a Defense Stack

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

[Content Security Policy (CSP)](/content-security-policy-csp) constrains which origins can serve scripts, styles, and media. Start with `default-src 'self'` and only open specific directives for known hosts. Pair CSP reports with alerting so you see violations before attackers do.

### Sanitize Early, Encode Late

[Input Sanitization](/input-sanitization) cleans untrusted data as it arrives, removing disallowed tags or attributes. When you render that data, [Output Encoding](/output-encoding) neutralizes the remaining payloads by escaping HTML entities contextually (attributes vs. text nodes).

### Enforce Trusted Sinks

Adopt [Trusted Types](/trusted-types) so dangerous DOM APIs accept only validated values. This breaks entire classes of DOM-based XSS while letting component authors focus on UI logic. Provide helper utilities that convert sanitized strings into `TrustedHTML` so teams avoid bypass patterns.

### Block Request Forgery

Combine [CSRF Protection](/csrf-protection) tokens with SameSite cookies. For single-page apps that rely on fetch calls, ensure the CSRF token travels with each request and expires alongside the session. Add integration tests that submit critical forms with and without tokens to verify coverage.

## Operationalize the Controls

- Integrate dependency scanning and `npm audit` gates so compromised third-party packages cannot sneak arbitrary script execution around CSP.
- Elevate security checks into CI. Lint for forbidden sinks like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, run unit tests that assert sanitizer behavior, and verify CSP headers on preview builds.
- Share a security scorecard with product teams. Track how often new routes skip CSP allowlists, where sanitization utilities are bypassed, and which components need review before release.

## Respond and Iterate

- Set up a playbook that rotates CSP reporting endpoints and reviews logs weekly. High volumes signal either legitimate bugs in new features or early signs of exploitation.
- When incidents happen, capture the payload and patch sanitizers, encoders, and trusted type policies together. A single fix rarely covers every vector.
- Revisit this stack quarterly. Browsers continue to add security primitives, and aligning them with your patterns keeps defenses ahead of attackers.

Ship features knowing each layer neutralizes a different class of threats. Defense in depth is not a slogan; it is the only reliable way to protect real users in modern frontends.
