# Testing Confidence Ladder

No single test type catches every regression. Reliable frontends rely on a layered suite that moves from fast feedback to full user journeys. This guide lays out how to combine key testing patterns so each layer reinforces the next without duplicating effort.

## Define the Rungs

- **Component correctness:** Validate isolated UI logic quickly with [Component Testing](/component-testing).
- **State-heavy utilities:** Cover reducers, selectors, and hooks using [Stateful Logic Testing](/stateful-logic-testing) when components would be overkill.
- **Cross-component flows:** Assert integrated behavior with [Integration Testing](/integration-testing) to keep routing, data fetching, and shared context in sync.
- **User perception:** Catch visual drift through [Visual Regression](/visual-regression) snapshots.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensure assistive users stay supported via [Accessibility Testing](/accessibility-testing).

## Build Reliable Inputs

- Use [Test Data Builder](/test-data-builder) utilities to keep fixtures realistic and flexible. Builders document domain invariants, making it easier to generate edge cases without brittle factories.
- Store builders next to the code they exercise. When models evolve, tests fail near the source and guide updates.
- Layer builders with type-safe defaults so failing tests highlight what changed instead of exploding with undefined behavior.

## Optimize Component Confidence

- Mock only what the component itself owns. Shared context providers can wrap tests to mirror production usage.
- Assert user visible outcomes instead of implementation details. For example, query rendered text or role attributes rather than checking internal state.
- Keep run time fast. Component suites should finish in seconds so developers trust them during refactors.

## Capture Real Journeys

- Promote critical flows to [Integration Testing](/integration-testing). Cover login, checkout, and onboarding with scenarios that hit actual network boundaries (mocked via MSW) and routing logic.
- Aim for one high value integration per essential user journey. Too many end-to-end tests slow the pipeline and increase flakiness.
- Record analytics during these simulations to validate that tracking fires exactly once per interaction.

## Guard Presentation and Accessibility

- Run [Visual Regression](/visual-regression) snapshots on design system components and high traffic pages. Lock in breakpoints and theme variants so you catch unintended shifts early.
- Complement visuals with [Accessibility Testing](/accessibility-testing). Automate lint checks for ARIA and color contrast, then schedule manual sweeps with screen readers before major releases.

## Keep the Ladder Healthy

- Track coverage across layers, not as a single percentage, but as a matrix that shows which routes lack integration or accessibility validation.
- Review flaky tests weekly. Remove or rewrite unreliable assertions quickly before they erode confidence.
- Tie tests to deployment stages. For example, run component and stateful logic suites on every commit, execute integration and visual suites on pull requests, and gate releases on a nightly accessibility run.

With a clear ladder, teams know where to add a test, how much fidelity it needs, and which failures matter most. Confidence comes from the combination, not any single rung.
