# Managing Async UX States

Network trips, caching layers, and user interactions rarely line up perfectly. Without a plan, apps flicker between loading spinners, stale data, and confusing errors. This guide shows how to combine proven async patterns so users stay informed and in control regardless of latency or failure.

## Define the Async Contract

- Start by mapping the lifecycle for each API call: idle, pending, success, empty, partial, and error. Document how components react at each boundary.
- Identify requests that can be grouped or split. Chunking large forms into smaller mutations lets you manage failure recovery with more precision.
- Establish UX principles with product design. Decide when to block, when to allow background updates, and how to surface retry affordances without annoying users.

## Guard Rendering with Boundaries

- Wrap data fetching regions in [Async Boundary](/async-boundary) components that catch errors and display fallback UI. This stabilizes the tree and keeps your layout intact even when child components fail.
- Combine boundaries with route level error pages so fatal issues never render blank screens. Ensure analytics events fire when boundaries trigger to highlight hidden instability.

## Communicate Progress Clearly

- Use [Loading State](/loading-state) patterns tailored to the context. Inline indicators work for small UI sections, while skeletons or blocking overlays fit larger data loads.
- Distinguish between initial load and refresh states. Users tolerate a skeleton on first visit, but during refresh you should prefer subtle pull-to-refresh indicators or optimistic updates.

## Keep Users Productive with Optimism

- Apply [Optimistic Update](/optimistic-update) so the UI reflects user intent immediately. Store rollback payloads so you can revert when the server rejects a change.
- Pair optimism with validation. Disable conflicting actions until confirmation arrives, or clearly mark entries as syncing to avoid double submissions.

## Engineer for Failure and Recovery

- Bring [Retry](/retry) strategies into your data layer with exponential backoff and jitter. Surface retry counts to the UI so you can inform the user before giving up.
- Integrate [Request Cancellation](/request-cancellation) to abort stale fetches when users navigate away or change filters. This prevents race conditions where outdated responses overwrite current state.
- Log failures with enough metadata to reproduce. Which endpoint failed, how long it took, and whether a retry succeeded all help triage production issues faster.

## Validate Continuously

- Add integration tests that force slow responses and server errors, asserting that boundaries, loading states, and optimistic rollbacks behave as expected.
- Monitor pending requests in production. A rising count often signals that cancellation hooks are missing or that the backend is overwhelmed.
- Review async copy with UX writers. Clear, human language builds trust when things take longer than expected.

Handled deliberately, async states become a competitive advantage instead of a liability. Treat loading, errors, and retries as part of the core UX, not incidental edge cases.
