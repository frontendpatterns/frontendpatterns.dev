# Accessible Interaction Playbook

Accessibility is more than semantic markup. As soon as users interact with your product, focus order, announcements, and motion choices determine whether the experience is inclusive. This playbook shows how to orchestrate key patterns so every interactive flow works with keyboards, assistive tech, and diverse sensory needs.

## Start with Intentional Focus

- Establish a single logical focus path per screen. Make sure modals, drawers, and ephemeral UIs trap focus until dismissed using [Focus Management](/focus-management).
- Insert [Skip Links](/skip-links) at the top of each page so keyboard and screen reader users can jump straight to primary content.
- Validate focus order during design reviews. Annotated wireframes prevent last minute focus hacks that break consistency.

## Guarantee Keyboard Coverage

- Apply the [Keyboard Navigation](/keyboard-navigation) pattern to ensure every control exposes visible focus, responds to expected key bindings, and avoids key conflicts with assistive tech.
- Provide shortcuts only when they have alternatives. For complex editors, publish keyboard maps and keep them configurable.
- Test flows with hardware switches or screen reader keyboard commands. Pointer interactions often hide missing focus handlers.

## Communicate Changes in Real Time

- Use [Live Regions](/live-regions) to announce dynamic updates. Toasts, validation messages, and background sync status should surface through assistive tech without stealing focus.
- Keep announcements concise and relevant. Overloading live regions desensitizes users and buries important signals.
- Align with localization. Ensure translated copy fits the same region and cadence so announcements remain understandable.

## Control Motion and Feedback

- Adopt [Accessible Animation](/accessible-animation) to respect reduced motion preferences. Offer equivalent cues like opacity changes or text updates when motion is disabled.
- Break long transitions into short, purposeful motions. Pair motion with audio or haptic feedback only when it reinforces the same message.

## Support Screen Readers Thoughtfully

- Follow the [Screen Reader](/screen-reader) pattern to select appropriate roles, labels, and states. Double check that status text updates when toggles or switches change.
- Announce context when focus moves into complex widgets. Screen reader tutorials help users understand editing modes, selection counts, or keyboard instructions.

## Operationalize Inclusion

- Bake accessibility acceptance criteria into stories. Define expected focus targets, announcements, and motion behaviors before implementation.
- Run weekly manual audits with screen readers across platforms. Narrator, VoiceOver, NVDA, and TalkBack each surface different quirks.
- Capture accessibility regressions in automated tests. Tools like axe can verify skip links exist, while end-to-end tests assert focus moves to the right component after interactions.

Delivering accessible interactions is an ongoing practice. When these patterns become muscle memory, your product works for more people without slowing the team down.
